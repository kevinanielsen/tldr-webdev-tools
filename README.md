# TLDR Web Dev - Launches and Tools collection
TLDR Web Dev is an amazing newsletter for all things related to web development, they include a section on recent launches and tools related to web development, which I am especially fond of, this is a collection of the launches and tools dating back to the 2nd of September 2023.

The page automatically updates each day a new issue of TLDR Web Dev is published, so you can always keep up to date with the latest launches and tools.
